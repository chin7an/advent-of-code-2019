# Introduction
Collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).
Using this year's series as a way to learn Ruby programming.

## TODO list
- [ ] Refactor code to be more object-oriented
- [ ] Refactor the project to use Rake as a build tool instead of adhoc IDE runs
- [ ] Implement the daily challenges as RSpec tests
- [ ] Utilize ruby blocks, `yield` function where there is a lot of repetitive code
- [ ] Understand and write-up scoping of variables in Ruby
